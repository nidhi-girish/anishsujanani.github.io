## A commonly overlooked PHP programming flaw, Linux magic numbers, Python and NC. How much could go wrong?

## Understanding the Application
- **Navigating to our test application brings us to an upload page:**

```
<html>
  <h1>Upload an image:</h1>
  <form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"">
    <input type="file" name="userfile" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" name="submit" />
  </form>
</html>
```

- **After uploading a file, we get back a link that we can follow to either view the image and/or share it with others:**

```
if( isset($_POST["submit"]) ) {
	$upload_dir = "./uploads";
	$upload_name = $upload_dir . $_FILES["userfile"]["name"];
	if( move_uploaded_file($_FILES["userfile"]["tmpname"], $upload_name) ) {
		echo("Success! Here's the image you uploaded: <br><br>");
		echo("View/Share link: <a href='http://localhost:5000/view.php?id='" . $_FILES["userfile"]["name"] . "'>Share!</a>);
	}
	else {
		echo("Upload error");
	}
}
else {
	echo("Please upload a file.");
}
```

- **Viewing the image:**

```
<?
  include("./uploads" . $_GET['id']);
  // storing the above in a variable, further processing ...
?>
```

Typically, developers would implement file type both on client side using JavaScript as well as on the backend either through just a string comparison of the `file extension` or through the `EXIF header checks` in the case of PHP applications. This ensures that users upload only images and not (for example) PHP code that could be interpreted.

The `exif_imagetype(string $filename)` function returns the type of an image based on the first few bytes present in the file. These bytes typically found at the start of the file are called `Magic File Numbers` and are responsible for defining actual file types to the operating system dealing with them. As you would expect, each file type/extension would have a unique set of identifying bytes.

This implies that only the first few bytes are considered in validating a file type. Bytes beyond the scope of the magic number length are responsible for other attributes of the file such as width/height for images or content and format specifiers in case of documents.

### What happens when we try injecting random non-file-specific data into the file? Can we still convince the OS that the file is valid?
Below is a snippet from a tool I wrote to embed content in media files.
```
# also modifying height, width, bit-depth of image
# hardcoded to 256x256, 24-bit depth
# uses the args dict, eg: args = {'ext' = 'png', text = 'some text here'}
def inj2png(args):
	rfname = getRandomFileName()
	with open(rfname + '.' + args.ext, 'wb') as f:
		f.write(b'\x89\x50\x4e\x47\x0d\x0a\x1a\x0a\x00\x00\x00\x0d\x49\x48\x44\x52 \
            \x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x18\x45\x4e\x44\xae\x42\x60\x82' + \
            args.text.encode())
	print(rfname + '.' + args.ext, ' was written.')
```

Running the script, hexdump-ing the resulting image and running the OS provided `file` command shows:
![webapp_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_3.png)

Magic bytes at the start of the file could get us past OS file checks as well as exif checks in PHP. Letâ€™s introduce a heavily flawed practice to understand the damage these concepts could do together.

`include(string $filename); // require() also problematic`

*The include and require statements take all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses these statements.*

In case of our web application, once you upload an image, it is invoked server-side through an `include()` statement. The same effect could be caused by trying to request the file, causing a vulnerable web server to execute the code. We know that this call would evaluate any valid PHP in the included file.

## What happens if we embed PHP?
### Server-side execution
![webapp_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_4.PNG)

Once uploaded, we get the following:
![webapp_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_5.PNG)

On clicking the image, the server would `include()` the file we just uploaded, causing the payload to run, resulting in:
![webapp_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_6.png)

### Returning JS
![webapp_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_7.png)

On following the view/share link, we get a page that shows:
![webapp_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_8.png)

Unless cookies are marked http-only, we now have access to them via the JS browser API.

### Remote Login
On our remote machine:
`nc -lvp 4444`

Make sure firewall rules ALLOW on the port:
```
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 4444 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 4444 -j ACCEPT
```

![webapp_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/webapp_9.png)

Once we upload the image and follow the view/share link, we see a connection log on our listener - we have a shell on the system.

If the web-server was running as root, we would now have full access to the system. 

## Preventing all of the above
- Validating files based on just their extensions via string comparisons is pointless.
- Validating files by content through EXIF functions or the underlying OS is a shade better and does provide some protection.
- Validating file size is an added layer of defence but could also be spoofed by modifying additional bytes following the magic number range.
- Going through the file and looking for suspect characters is a sure-fire way of preventing the above, but is not very practical to implement.
- Do not trust user input. Do not use include() or require() directly for any sort of processing on user uploaded files. Always sanitize input and check against a white-list.
- *Run the web server with a limited set of permissions.* The process should be limited to directories and files that it needs, with minimum required permissions.
- Harden your server. Remove the tools you do not need and do not allow outgoing connections unless absolutely required. Even so, implement a whitelist for the same. 
- WAF and HIDS should be configured to pick up on abnormal behaviour.
